🧠 Microservices ArchiTecture 

A backend system built using Node.js and Express.js, implementing the Microservices Architecture. This project features a Common API Gateway for centralized request handling and an Identity Service for user authentication and authorization.



🌐 Services Overview
1. 🔀 Common API Gateway (api-gateway)
    Acts as the single entry point for all microservices
    Proxies requests to the appropriate service

    Implements:
   
        Rate limiting
        CORS
        Logging
        Token forwarding
        Request validation

3. 🛂 Identity Service (identity-service)
      Responsible for user management

    Implements:
   
        User Registration
        User Login
        JWT-based Authentication
        Password Hashing

5.🛠 Technologies Used

  Node.js + Express.js
  MongoDB (with Mongoose)
  JWT for Authentication
  ioredis + rate-limit-redis
  Helmet, CORS, dotenv
  Winston for logging


6.🛣️ API Gateway Endpoints
  Base URL:   
          
    http://localhost:3000/v1
  
  
    POST	    /auth/registerUser	       Register new user
    POST	    /auth/LoginUser	           Login existing user

📌 Note: These endpoints are proxied via the API Gateway to the Identity Service.


7.⚙️ Setup Instructions

      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Microservices-Backend.git
      cd Microservices-Backend
  
  Start the API Gateway
  
          cd api-gateway
          npm install
          npm run dev
    
  Start the Identity Service
  
          cd ../identity-service
          npm install
          npm run dev


8.🧪 Future Improvements

   Add user profile microservice
  
   Integrate API gateway authentication middleware
  
   Dockerize all services
  
   CI/CD pipeline
